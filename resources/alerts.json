Increased releases from Topaz Lake will also continue the high flows on the West Walker River below Topaz Lake.\n\nAs a result, flows into and below the Mason-Yerington area on the\nmainstem Walker River will remain high through the week. Flows will remain high through Mason and Yerington with levels possible reaching the crest seen on June 22nd. Based on the latest river data, continued prolonged minor flooding is likely through Mason/Yerington with moderate flooding below Yerington through the Wabuska area.\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe West Walker River Near Coleville.\n* until late Saturday night.\n* At  5:30 PM Tuesday the stage was 5.5 feet.\n* Flood stage is 6.0 feet.\n* Minor flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...Rise above flood stage by late Tuesday evening  and\ncontinue to rise to near 6.2 feet by early Wednesday morning.
